# Traffic Task 3 - Ingress Advanced

Inspect the `ingress-advanced.yaml` file and replace `<IP>` just like in task-2.
Create the ingress manifest:

```bash
kubectl apply -f ingress-advanced.yaml
```

Make sure to understand and check:
- What mechanisms are used to modify the HTTP resources
- What combinations are possible to access the hidden endpoint
- The result is `You found the hidden endpoint :)`
- HTTP response code is 200
